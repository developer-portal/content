### Local http server
You could use [nmp](https://www.npmjs.com/) to download and install a lightweight http server to view your changes.

* The [markdown-http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-http-server) works well and does not need to configure files in your working directory.
* `npm install -g markdown-http-server`
* `markdown-server`
