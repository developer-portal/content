# Learning resources

There is an official book describing the Rust programming language in detail.
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/index.html

More examples of the concepts discussed in the book are available in this collection:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/

When you finish with the language itself, there is an ongoing effort to create a set of examples of using core libraries for concurrency, data serialization, network programming, etc.
https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/intro.html

Finally, you can find community pages with a list of resources such as this one:

# API documentation

Standard library documentation:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/

Documentation for crates available at `crates.io`:
https://docs.rs/

# IDE recommendations

There are plugins for popular editor such as Vim, Atom or Gnome Software which are based on the Rust Language Server (RLS) implementation. Alternatively, IntelliJ IDEA provides their own, custom plugin. Unfortunatelly, the debugging support is available only in paid CLion IDE.

If you are brave enough and you want to try the nightly compiler edition (or you just want to try the awesome [Rocket framework](https://rocket.rs/)), it is recommended to use rustup:
