# .NET SDK installation

.NET Core is still work in progress, and below download locations contain packages that are not entirely _free._ Please be patient, we should have reasonable packages within a few months.

Choose based on your Fedora and SDK version:

* [Microsoft's 2.0 preview2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/preview#linuxfedora) (F25 `.csproj`)
* [Fedora .NET SIG packages](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/nmilosev/dotnet-sig) (F25+ 1.1 `.json`)
