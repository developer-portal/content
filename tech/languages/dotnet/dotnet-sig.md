# DotNet SIG

The [DotNet SIG](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/DotNet) is a group of Fedora contributors that maintain `dotnet` (and related) packages in Fedora. The goal of this group is to help to anyone interested in dotnet and to support others in creating and maintaining dotnet applications. See our [wiki page](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/DotNet) for more details, ways to get in touch, or information about [joining the SIG](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/DotNet/Join).

## .NET Foundation

You can contribute to the .NET Core upstream on [GitHub.com/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet)
