## API Reference

The documentation by Microsoft for the .NET Framework API generally applies to Mono as well, with minor differences.
You can find the .NET Framework API documentation for versions 4.5 and higher at [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/index?view=netframework-4.5).
In the Fedora packages for Mono, we don't support earlier versions of the .NET Framework API.
