## Summary

JetBrains Rider is the most complete C# IDE, however it is not open source.

VS Code and MonoDevelop work well for .NET Core and for Mono, respectively.

C# via Eclipse is still young and not very friendly for the former Windows developer, but it can be useful if you're already an Eclipse IDE user.
