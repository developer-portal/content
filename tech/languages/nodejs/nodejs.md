# Node.js

## Node.js and npm installation

Starting from Fedora 24, npm is a part of Node.js package and does not need to be installed separately. Therefore, to install both npm and Node.js, you need to run:

```
$ sudo dnf install nodejs
```

This will install V8 Javascript Engine, Node.js runtime and npm package manager and their dependencies. Versions present in repositories are usually current or to-be (in Rawhide) Node.js LTS releases, including npm and V8 engine that come with them.

### Alternative versions

There are alternative versions available as [Fedora Modules](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/modularity/using-modules/). 

**Note:** Modules are available for all editions from Fedora 29, and on the Server Edition from Fedora 28.

To list all available versions, run:

```
$ dnf module list
```

And to install an alternative version, run a command similar to this:

```
$ sudo dnf module install nodejs:8
```

### Managing multiple versions with nvm

[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#about) (Node Version Manager) is a bash script to manage multiple Node.js versions. nvm makes it easier to install, uninstall, and switch between different versions. Visit it's Github page to follow the latest [installation instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

## Yarn

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) package manager is available since Fedora 29. You can install it by running:

```
$ sudo dnf install yarnpkg
```

Yarn can be used in the following manner:

```
$ yarnpkg add request
$ yarn add request
```

## Installing npm modules

Installing Node.js modules is covered in [Node.js modules](/tech/languages/nodejs/modules.html).
