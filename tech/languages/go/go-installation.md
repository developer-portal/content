# Go on Fedora

Quoting the upstream documentation:

> The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive.

> Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

## Go installation

To install the Go tools, type on a terminal:

```console
$ sudo dnf install golang
```

The `go` and `gofmt` binaries will become available on the system.

Go code lives in [a workspace](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces) which is defined by the `GOPATH` environment variable. A common choice among developers, and the [default value of `GOPATH` starting from the Go 1.8 release](https://tip.golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), is to use `$HOME/go`:

```console
$ mkdir -p $HOME/go
$ echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/go' >> $HOME/.bashrc
$ source $HOME/.bashrc
```

Check that `GOPATH` is set correctly with this command:

```console
$ go env GOPATH
/home/user/go
```

Where 'user' will be your user name.

Writing Go programs is covered in [Go programs](/tech/languages/go/go-programs.html).

## Fedora Specific Notes

The default installation of Go on Fedora contains two changes that Go developers should be aware of.

### GOPROXY

The value of `GOPROXY` in `$GOROOT/go.env` is set to `direct`. A value of `direct` disables access to the module mirror. See [https://proxy.golang.org](https://proxy.golang.org) for more information on `GOPROXY` and the module mirror. A project specifc `go.env` can override this setting.

### GOTOOLCHAIN

Go 1.21 introduces `GOTOOLCHAIN` which facilitates project specific choices for the Go language toolchain of compiler, standard library, assembler, and other tools. The value of `GOTOOLCHAIN` is set to `local` instead of the default `auto`. See the [Go Toolchain](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain) documentation for more information on toolchains in Go and the implications of using `local` as the default. A project specific `go.env` file can override this setting.
