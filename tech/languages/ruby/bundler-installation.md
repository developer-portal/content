# Bundler installation

To install Bundler on Fedora as a gem, install Ruby first and then run:

```
$ sudo dnf install ruby
$ gem install bundler
```

Or install RPM-packaged Bundler alternatively with:

```
$ sudo dnf install rubygem-bundler
```

Afterwards the `bundle` command should be available on your system.
