# s390(x)

s390 is 31-bit-address/32-bit-data and s390x is 64 bit computing architecture. s390(x) is [big endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) and used in IBM mainframe computers which is also known as [IBM System z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_z).

## Building your application for s390(x) architecture


To build a package for s390(x) architecture in Fedora, use s390-koji command:

```
$ s390-koji build --scratch rawhide srpm_pkg1
```

The above command will start a scratch build of package srpm_pkg1 against Fedora rawhide for s390 and s390x architectures. Use "s390-koji \-\-help" in console to see all available options.

To build against other Fedora branches (e.g. F23, F24), specify specific branch name to s390-koji in argument:

```
s390-koji build --scratch F24 srpm_pkg1
```

To package application exclusively for s390(x) archiecture, use ExclusiveArch tag in [RPM spec file](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package#Creating_a_SPEC_file)

```
ExclusiveArch:  s390, s390x
```

## Example

In Secondary Architectures section, we saw how to get/create iprutils srpm as an example. Now, you already have srpm (src.rpm) file of iprutils.
The following example will demonstrate how to build an application for s390(x) architecture from srpm:

```
# Initiate iprutils package build for s390(x) architecture
$ s390-koji build --scratch rawhide iprutils-2.4.11.1-1.fc25.src.rpm 
  Created task: 2183374
  Task info: http://s390.koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=2183374
  ....

```
For each build, a Task ID is created in s390 koji. You can view build status and it's log by going to the url provided in Task info.


## Viewing koji builds

Builds specific to s390(x) are hosted at [http://s390.koji.fedoraproject.org/](http://s390.koji.fedoraproject.org/). UI is very similar to [primary koji](http://koji.fedoraproject.org/).
